To help me learn more about github and stuff, please let me know if there are issues with this repository at all! Sometetimes, you can't just
see problems with what you're doing.

This is a pretty basic personal project that I'll be working on for a while, but I think I will get a lot of value in the research side of 
all this. I'll build something simple, then look into something that does it better, but is more complicated, and maybe find that what I've
built doesn't support this new thing that well. At that point, I hope I'll learn more about refactoring, and also just building a foundation
that scales. 

Also I like C and it would be cool to do this project with it, so I hope I'll learn a lot about it here too.
